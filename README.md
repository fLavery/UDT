# Website for Univrsal Data Technologies
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is a website for an Accounting/Computer Technology Consultants business.
It includes the broad combination of both Accounting expertise and Software Development capabilities of the business.


## Demo
A live demo can be found 

## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site, while striving for a minimalist design. The layout may not be the most up-to-date design
but if satisfies the requirements of the client and delivers on functional aspects of his requirements.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)


## Features
The website had been originally design for a desktop experience but has been modified to be a responsive website capable of viewing on handheld devices.
The website originally used a Google Maps location finder and display but has now been switched to the more open source Leaflet.js Open Street Maps rendering without a cost.

The technical section includes the source of a HTML rendered Layout that can be incorporated in a html email.



## Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.


## Deployment 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can `git clone` the code to run it locally on your machine.

## Credits

### Content
All content sections in this website come from source documents delivered by the client.

### Media
